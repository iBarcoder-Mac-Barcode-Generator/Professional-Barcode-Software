iBarcoder is a powerful and reliable utility designed for creating professional-grade barcodes and QR codes. It serves as an essential tool for businesses, educators, and individuals who need to generate accurate, scannable codes for a multitude of purposes. From product packaging and library systems to event tickets and contactless menus, iBarcoder provides the functionality required for efficient code creation.

This application stands out due to its comprehensive support for numerous barcode symbologies. Whether you need a standard UPC for a retail product, a QR code to link to a website, or a Code 39 for internal inventory, iBarcoder handles it with precision. The software ensures that all generated codes meet industry standards for readability and accuracy.

A key strength of iBarcoder is its deep customization options. Users are not limited to standard black-and-white codes; they can adjust colors to match branding, embed custom text labels above or below the barcode, and fine-tune the resolution and size for any application. The batch generation feature is a significant time-saver, allowing for the creation of hundreds of unique codes from a spreadsheet or list in a single operation.

Built with a focus on performance and integration, iBarcoder operates smoothly within the macOS environment. It leverages the system's capabilities to provide a fast, responsive experience. Outputs are delivered in print-ready vector formats like PDF and SVG, ensuring no loss of quality at any size, as well as common image formats for immediate digital use.
